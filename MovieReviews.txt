Review: This is my all time favorite movie, this movie is a spin-off of the orginal movie "Alice in Wonderland" from 1951. The main characters are Alice Kingsleigh and the mad hatter. Those two individuals really bring the movie together with their great acting skills. The movie starts with alice in her room asa kid with her crazy sister "the red queen" they go on a quest to gain back the thrown of the red queen.

Movie: TrainToBusan
Review: This movie is marked as one of my top 5 movies to watch since it has it all. The movie consist of action, comedy and emotion which connected to the audience. It is a zombie movie where the main character is a guy who has a daughter who doesn't want to be with him anymore. They go on a train to meet the daughters mom but instead are met with a outbreak in the train. Throughout the movie they build character within each other and survive the hoard of zombies.

Movie: Spiderman: No Way Home
Review: Spiderman, aka Peter Parker, had his identity revealed by Mysterio in the previous movie, Spiderman: Far From Home, and because of that, Peter now has to live with the public harassing him and those he holds dear. To fix this, Peter goes to see Dr. Strange to cast a spell to make everyone forget that Peter is Spiderman, but because of Peter's constant changes to the spell, the spell botches and releases the villains from the previous Spidermen franchises. After the death of Aunt May, and with the help of the previous Spidermen, he helps the villains with their 'problems' so that they could have a chance of not dying when returning to their universes. After saving them, the spell from before starts to rip the fabric of reality, so Peter asks Dr. Strange to cast a spell to make everyone forget Peter Parker, and after doing so, Peter goes back to being a vigilante hero.

Movie: Sonic the Hedgehog 2
Review: It was kind of cringe, being a family movie it had its moments. But seeing the film was entertaining nonetheless. There were some really cool references to the games I played as a kid. I was a really big fan of the retro sonic games and some elements of the games were present in the movie, although they did not feature the famous red plane that much which was saddening to me. Though the movie also focuses on Sonic too much, the movie was nice to sit through.
